Authors: [Caddick, Z. A.](https://zacharycaddick.com/), 

## Description
This script extracts past game data from 'SBSolver.com' for The New York Times Spelling Bee. With an input DataFrame containing unstructured text, the script processes and extracts various game metrics, including word counts, scores, pangrams, and more, returning a structured DataFrame.

## Features
- **Extracts game date.**
- **Identifies the letters for each game** â€“ the center letters and the outer letters for each puzzle.
- **Parses out** the word list, total word count, scores, and pangrams.
- **Retrieves a list** of unique letters used in the pangrams.
- **Categorizes the word length** and its respective count.
  
## How to Use
1. Ensure you have `pandas` and `re` modules installed.
2. Import the `extract_data_from_text` function from the script.
3. Prepare a pandas DataFrame (`df`) with a column named "Text" containing unstructured data.
4. Call the function and pass your DataFrame: 
    ```python
    df_processed = extract_data_from_text(df)
    ```
5. The `df_processed` DataFrame will now contain structured game data.

1. **date**: The date of the Spelling Bee game.
